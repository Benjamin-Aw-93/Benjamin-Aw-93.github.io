# What is the Data Arcade Tournament about?
GovTech Data Science and AI division hosted an event at Suntec which aimed to connect data scientist and analysts across different Ministries and Statutory Boards. 600 public officers gathered to form 140+ teams to participate in a knock-out round where teams were tasked to create a dashboard using Qlik or Tableau with data they have sourced through the internet. Furthermore, GovTechâ€™s Whole-Of-Government-Application-Analytics team also chipped in with their data which can be found [here](https://data.gov.sg/).   

On 4<sup>th</sup> December, 6 teams were shortlisted to compete with each other to derive meaningful insights using their selected data visualisation tools. Just like any data analysis problem, a meaningful problem statement was crafted prior to the competition. The problem statement presented was to find insights to sustain and encourage the users on Giving.sg to do more good, from datasets which the National Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre(NVPC) has kindly contributed.


# Why did we join the Data Arcade Tournament?
Let me ask you a question. Have you ever walked into a minimalist art museum and went, "Anyone can do that!" That was how I felt when I first joined the competition. Looking at dashboards online, I confidently proclaimed, "You know what? How hard can creating a dashboard be? I mean, its just graphs and charts being put together!"

Not to mention that the top 6 teams were rewarded with an iPad mini. With our eyes on the prize, my two teammates and I decided to enter the competition. And before we even knew it, we were crowned the winners of the competition for the Qlik track.

So how did we do it? What was our recipe for success?

# Telling Data Stories
I think one of the main reasons why we won the tournament was because the team had a strong data story to tell. While the other teams were focusing on how they could present the numbers in a palatable format for their audience (which is not wrong by the way, it really depends on what your business users, or in this case the judges, want to see) and ended up looking more like an infographic, our team focused on reading up on NVPC's business models to create hypothesis and assumptions, and subsequently dig deeper into the data to find insights to answer these hypotheses. We made sure that our dashboard had a flow; an introduction, a body and a conclusion that wraps everything up together.

It helps to also be the anchor of the team. There were many times where a teammate will suggest to look at other aspects of the data so that we are able to create those beautiful charts that we see online. While it was nice to have a dreamer/idealist on the team, before putting any charts onto the dashboard, we had to take a step back to ask ourselves, "How does this fit into our storyline?" If it doesn't, then the decision to scrape the idea had to be made. Sometimes, it is difficult to let go of ideas. But with a giant clock right in front of us ticking away, it made it a lot easier to trash ideas into the bin.

# Working as a team
It is important that you learn to work along side with others to complement on each other's strengths and cover each other weakness. While the saying "More is always better" does not always hold true, "The more diverse the better" seems to have stood against the test of time yet again.

Within the team, each of our roles were defined clearly.
* The story-teller
* The painter
* The miner

## The story-teller
The story-teller's job is to create the path to guide our audience along. Their job is to ensure that there is a coherent narrative and that each idea flows smoothly to the next, like fine wine. Without the story-teller, the dashboard would turn into an infographic instead.  

## The painter
The painter's job is to create visuals to mesmerise our audience. There is no need to use fanciful colours and visuals to trap your audience. Sometimes, a chart's beauty is in it's simplicity. Without the painter, the dashboard would turn into a static report instead.

## The miner
The miner's job is the most important of them all. Because without them, there is no data to analyse. Their job is to dig deep into the data to find the gems which support our hypotheses. Without the miner, analysis done would only be surface level and not substantial.

Everyone played a pivotal role during the competition and I think that was the other reason for our success.
