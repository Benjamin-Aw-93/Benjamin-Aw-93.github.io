# What is the Data Arcade Tournament about?

# Why did we join the Data Arcade Tournament?

Have you ever walked into a minimalist art museum and went, "You know what? Anyone can do that!" That was how I felt when I first joined the competition. I told my colleagues, "How hard can creating a dashboard be? I mean, its just graphs and charts being put together!"

So with unfounded confidence, my two other colleagues and I decided to enter the competition.

Little did we know, we were stepping into uncharted territory, a world full of pain and agony.
